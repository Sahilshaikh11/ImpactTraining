# Q1. subarray sum equals k
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, 
return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2

# maximum summation 
Given an integer array nums, find the 
subarray
 with the largest sum, and return its sum.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

# neighbours not equal k
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of distinct integers. 
You want to rearrange the elements in the array such that every element
in the rearranged array is not equal to the average of its neighbors.

More formally, the rearranged array should have the property such that for 
every i in the range 1 <= i < nums.length - 1, (nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2 is not 
equal to nums[i].

Return any rearrangement of nums that meets the requirements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,4,5,3]
Explanation:
When i=1, nums[i] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (1+4) / 2 = 2.5.
When i=2, nums[i] = 4, and the average of its neighbors is (2+5) / 2 = 3.5.
When i=3, nums[i] = 5, and the average of its neighbors is (4+3) / 2 = 3.5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,2,0,9,7]
Output: [9,7,6,2,0]
Explanation:
When i=1, nums[i] = 7, and the average of its neighbors is (9+6) / 2 = 7.5.
When i=2, nums[i] = 6, and the average of its neighbors is (7+2) / 2 = 4.5.
When i=3, nums[i] = 2, and the average of its neighbors is (6+0) / 2 = 3.

# next permutation 
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members 
into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of
arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically
greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations 
of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, 
then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the
sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged 
as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does 
not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
